            <h1>Results Summary</h1>
            <p>
                A total of four case studies were conducted to get direct input and observe the difficulties college students face when registering for classes on IIT's student portal. The participants were tasked with registering for courses, some with linked labs and others without, to evaluate their navigation and registration experiences.
            </p>

            <h2>Participants and Experience Levels</h2>
            <p>
                The participants varied in experience levels:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-college students with no prior experience using registration systems.</li>
                <li>Non-IIT college students familiar with other portals but not IIT's system.</li>
                <li>IIT students using the portal on desktop devices.</li>
                <li>IIT students accessing the portal on mobile devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Several usability issues were identified:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inexperienced users had difficulty submitting their schedule due to unclear button placement and cluttered layouts.</li>
                <li>Searching for courses was challenging for all users due to cluttered information and excessive white spaces, making navigation frustrating.</li>
                <li>Experienced users were accustomed to the layout but still found navigation unintuitive and the process unnecessarily repetitive.</li>
                <li>Linked courses were difficult to register for without prior knowledge, requiring extra steps and causing confusion.</li>
                <li>Color coding of courses was inconsistent, making it harder to identify related labs and lectures.</li>
                <li>Error messages were overly technical and difficult to interpret, leaving participants unsure of how to resolve issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Themes</h2>
            <p>
                Across all participants, several recurring issues emerged:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Unintuitive Navigation:</span> Navigation was repetitive, and pathways to complete tasks were unclear.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Error Messages:</span> Participants found error messages confusing, with unclear guidance for resolving issues.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Linked Courses:</span> Handling linked courses was inefficient, requiring unnecessary extra steps.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Cluttered Layout:</span> Excessive white space and a lack of visual hierarchy made the interface overwhelming for users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The usability audit revealed that common issues such as unclear navigation, cluttered layouts, and unhelpful error messages significantly hindered the user experience. Addressing these problems is crucial to creating a registration process that is more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for all students.
