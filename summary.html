            <h1>Results Summary</h1>
            <p>
                A total of four case studies were conducted to get direct input and observe the difficulties college students face when registering for classes on IIT's student portal. The participants were tasked with registering for courses, some with linked labs and others without, to evaluate their navigation and registration experiences.
            </p>

            <h2>Participants and Experience Levels</h2>
            <p>
                The participants varied in experience levels:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-college student with no prior experience using registration systems.</li>
                <li>Non-IIT college student familiar with other portals but not IIT's system.</li>
                <li>IIT student using the portal on desktop devices.</li>
                <li>IIT student accessing the portal on mobile devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <p>
                Several usability issues were identified:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Inexperienced users:</span> had difficulty submitting their schedule due to <span class="highlight">unclear button placement</span> and <span class="highlight">cluttered layouts</span>.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Searching for courses:</span> was challenging for all users due to <span class="highlight">cluttered information</span> and <span class="highlight">excessive white spaces</span>, making navigation frustrating.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Experienced users:</span> were accustomed to the layout but still found navigation <span class="highlight">unintuitive</span> and the process unnecessarily repetitive.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Linked courses:</span> were difficult to register for without prior knowledge, requiring <span class="highlight">extra steps</span> and causing confusion.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Color coding:</span> of courses was inconsistent, making it harder to identify related labs and lectures.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Error messages:</span> were overly technical and difficult to interpret, leaving participants unsure of how to resolve issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Themes</h2>
            <p>
                Across all participants, several recurring issues emerged:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Unintuitive Navigation:</span> Navigation was repetitive, and pathways to complete tasks were unclear.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Error Messages:</span> Participants found error messages confusing, with unclear guidance for resolving issues.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Linked Courses:</span> Handling linked courses was inefficient, requiring unnecessary extra steps.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Cluttered Layout:</span> Excessive white space and a lack of visual hierarchy made the interface overwhelming for users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The usability audit revealed that common issues such as unclear navigation, cluttered layouts, and unhelpful error messages significantly hindered the user experience. Addressing these problems is crucial to creating a registration process that is more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for all students.
