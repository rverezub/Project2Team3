3. **Results Summary (summary.html)**

4. **Improvement Discussion (discussion.html)**  
   Elaborates on the suggested improvements for usability issues, explaining how each improvement addresses user challenges and enhances the registration process.

5. **Illustrations of Improvements (illustrations.html)**
