            <p>
                Illinois Tech’s Registration Portal (Banner) is an essential tool for students to manage their academic schedules, yet its current user interface presents significant challenges that hinder its effectiveness and usability. Key issues identified include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Mobile View Limitations:</span> The mobile interface lacks optimization, with panels often misaligned or difficult to view, making navigation cumbersome for users on smaller devices. Critical functionalities are either missing or hard to locate, which severely limits accessibility for students who rely on mobile devices.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Repetitive Class Searching:</span> Searching for classes requires users to repeatedly input course details without any intuitive filtering or suggestions. This creates a frustrating, time-consuming process for users unfamiliar with course codes or linked classes like labs and lectures.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Inconsistent Color Coding:</span> The color-coding scheme for paired lectures and labs is inconsistent, often leading users to perceive them as separate entities. This confusion frequently results in scheduling errors or missed registrations.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Unintuitive Error Messages:</span> Error messages often describe issues in technical terms, such as HTML formatting, which are incomprehensible to most users. This leaves students without clear guidance on how to resolve their problems, further complicating the registration process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To evaluate the usability of the Banner system and pinpoint areas for improvement, a usability audit was conducted with four participants representing diverse user groups:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Participants:</span> Included a mix of experienced and inexperienced users, both IIT and non-IIT students, using desktop and mobile platforms.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Tasks Assigned:</span> Participants registered for specific Spring 2025 courses, using the "Plan Ahead" feature to prevent disruption to existing schedules.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Metrics Measured:</span> Time taken, issues encountered, and resolution strategies were documented.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Post-Task Reflection:</span> Structured questionnaires captured feedback on color coding, positives, negatives, annoyances, and overall experience.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Observation and Documentation:</span> Proctors recorded unedited notes on user behaviors, missteps, and verbal feedback during the tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This combination of structured tasks, real-time observations, and reflective questioning provided a comprehensive view of the system’s shortcomings and informed targeted recommendations for improvement.
